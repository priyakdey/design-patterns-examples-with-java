# Design Pattern Examples and Use cases with Java


This repository is part of [me](https://github.com/priyakdey) learning basics of
software design project, called [Back to School] and documenting it for future reference.

This repository contains documents and example code to show how Design patterns work,
it may not be a 100% design, design cannot be perfect, but this is what I understand.
And since I say, **what I understand**, means this repo is probably going be changing over time,
with more insights and change in my thought process.

*Will update more about project details and how to run the examples*
